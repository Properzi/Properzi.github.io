abstract: 'In the combinatorial study of solutions to the Yang--Baxter equation (YBE), recently 
introduced ring-theoretical objects play a fundamental role: skew braces.\
A skew brace is a set with two group operations 
$+$ and $\circ$ satisfying a compatibility condition.
In a skew brace $(A,+,\circ)$,
the group $(A,\circ)$ acts on $(A,+)$ by automorphism
via the so-called $\lambda$-map, $\lambda\colon (A,\circ)\to\textrm{Aut}(A,+)$.
This action is involved in the (universal) construction of
the set-theoretic solutions to the YBE
provided by skew braces.
Furthermore, the $\lambda$-action deeply influences the structure of a finite skew brace,
as e.g. ideals are $\lambda$-invariant 
normal subgroups (for both group structures).
Motivated by similar ideas in representation theory
of finite groups (see [1])
and by the work of 
of Bertram, Herzog, and Mann [2], 
we study a *common divisor graph*:
the simple undirected graph whose vertices are the non-trivial $\lambda$-orbits 
and two vertices are adjacent if their sizes are not coprime. 
We provide some examples and prove
that it has at most two connected components
and that, in the connected case, its diameter
is at most four.
The main result is a complete classification of finite skew braces
with a one-vertex graph.
In particular, we have the following enumeration.\

**Theorem 1.**\
  *There are only three non-isomorphic finite skew braces with an abelian additive group and one-vertex graph.*\

**Theorem 2.**\

  *The number of non-isomorphic skew braces of size $2^md$ (with $d$ odd)
  whose graph has only one vertex is
  $ma(d)$ if $m\leq3$ and $2a(d)$ if $m\geq4$,
  where $a(d)$ is the number of isomorphism classes
  of abelian groups of order $d$.*\
