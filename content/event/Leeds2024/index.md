summary: "Biracks and Biquandles: Theory, applications, and new perspectives"

abstract: 'In joint work with  Carsten Dietzel and Senne Trappeniers, we study involutive indecomposable  solutions to the Yang-Baxter equation. These solutions correspond to a transitive permutation group that encodes their combinatorial properties through an associated permutation skew brace. Building on works by  Jedlička-Pilitowska and Cedó-Okniński, we fully classify solutions of prime-squared size.'
