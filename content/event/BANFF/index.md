summary: Skew Braces, Braids and the Yang-Baxter Equation (24w5201)

abstract: 'This talk is based on joint work with Carsten Dietzel and Senne Trappeniers. We study indecomposable involutive non-degenerate set-theoretic solutions to the Yang-Baxter equation. Building upon the works of Jedlička-Pilitowska and Cedó-Okniński and through the study of their associated permutation skew brace, we fully classify such solutions of prime-squared size.'
