summary: The Interplay Between Skew Braces and Hopf-Galois Theory

abstract: 'Inspired by a work of Bertram, Herzog, and Mann, we introduce a graph
associated with the $\lambda$-classes of a given finite skew brace. Given a finite skew
brace A, its graph of non-trivial $\lambda$-classes has as vertices the non-trivial Î»orbits of A and two vertices are adjacent if their sizes are not coprime.
This graph has similar properties to the one defined for groups by Bertram,
Herzog, and Mann: it has at most two connected components, some bounds
on the diameter and there is only one skew brace whose graph consists of
two disconnected vertices. On the other hand, in contrast to the group
version, there exist graphs with precisely one vertex, and skew braces with
this property can be classified completely.'
