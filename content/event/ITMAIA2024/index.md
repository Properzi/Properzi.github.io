summary: ITMAIA

abstract: 'A skew brace is an interlinking of two group structures on the same set, where one
group (called the multiplicative group) acts via the so-called $\lambda$-action by automorphisms on
the other (called the additive group). These structures play a fundamental role in the
combinatorial study of solutions to the Yangâ€“Baxter equation. Motivated by similar ideas
in representation theory of finite groups and by the work of of Bertram, Herzog, and Mann,
we study two common divisor graphs associated with skew braces. We first define this
graph in the general setting of any action of a group by automorphisms on another group.
We provide some examples and prove bound for the number of connected components and
for the diameter. We then pass to the case of skew braces and we classify all skew braces
with one of the graphs consisting of two disconnected vertices and with only one vertex.'
