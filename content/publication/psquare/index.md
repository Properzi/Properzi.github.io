abstract: The quantum Yang-Baxter equation is a braiding condition on vector spaces which is of high relevance in several fields of mathematics, such as knot theory and quantum group theory. Their combinatorial counterpart are set-theoretic solutions to the Yang--Baxter equation, whose investigation is strongly driven by the study of algebraic objects called (skew) braces. In this article, we focus on indecomposable involutive non-degenerate set-theoretic solutions to the Yang-Baxter equation. More specifically, through a thorough analysis of their associated braces, we give a full classification of those which are of size $p^2$, for $p$ a prime.
