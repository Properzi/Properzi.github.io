abstract: The quantum Yang-Baxter equation is a braiding condition on vector spaces which is of high relevance in several fields of mathematics, such as knot theory and quantum group theory. Their combinatorial counterpart are set-theoretic solutions to the Yang--Baxter equation, whose investigation is strongly driven by the study of algebraic objects called (skew) braces. In this article, we focus on indecomposable involutive non-degenerate set-theoretic solutions to the Yang-Baxter equation. More specifically, through a thorough analysis of their associated braces, we give a full classification of those which are of size $p^2$, for $p$ a prime.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: In this paper, we investigate the ideals of semidirect products of L-algebras and the structure of simple L-algebras. We provide a precise characterization of the ideals of semidirect products and describe the structure of their prime spectrum. Furthermore, we introduce a family of finite simple L-algebras and prove that every simple linear L-algebra belongs to this family. We also show that the family we construct coincides with the class of simple algebras in a certain subclass of finite CKL-algebras. As an application, we use these results to give a clear description of linear Hilbert algebras and their symmetric semidirect products.
