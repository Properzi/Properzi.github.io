abstract = {Let G be a finite group. Attach to G the following graph Γ: its vertices are the non-central conjugacy classes of G, and two vertices are connected if their cardinalities are not coprime. Denote by n(Γ) the number of the connecte components of Γ. We prove that n(Γ) ⩽ 2 for all finite groups, and we completely characterize groups with n(Γ) = 2. When Γ is connected, then the diameter of the graph is at most 4. For simple non-abelian finite groups, the graph is complete. Similar results are proved for infinite FC-groups.},
